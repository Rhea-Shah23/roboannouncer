An AI sports commentator that generates NBA game recaps in any style!

**Developer:** Rhea Shah

## Project Overview & Motivation: 
Sports content is consumed by millions on the daily, yet generating quality game recaps require hours of of human writing. RoboAnnouner explores whether AI can revolutionize sports journalism, enabling instant, stylized game narratives at your fingertips. 

To best fit the preferences of the user we will offer multiple writing styles such as: 
- Standard: Professional, ESPN-style game recaps
- Dramatic: Intense and exciting commentary
- Analytical: Stats-heavy and strategic breakdown

This project demonstrates: 
- End-to-end ML pipeline
- Real-world NLP applications
- Cost-conscious engienering

## Current Development:
I am still in the brainstorming stage of development and I'm starting the data collection process to fine-tune the LLM on over 1,000 NBA games and post-game recaps.
